# Crypto Libraries on IoT devices: A Detailed Characterization of Performance, Energy Efficiency, and Memory Footprint

This repository contains software to characterize C-language based crypto libraries on microprocessor-based IoT devices. 

The following crypto libraries were analysed:
1. OpenSSL
2. wolfSSL
3. GnuPG
4. PyCryptodome

The following Raspberry Pi devices and their OS versions were used:
1. ZeroW - Linux raspberrypi 6.1.19+ armv6l GNU/Linux
2. 3B+ - Linux raspberrypi 6.1.21-v8+ aarch64 GNU/Linux
3. 4B - Linux raspberrypi 6.1.21-v8+ aarch64 GNU/Linux
